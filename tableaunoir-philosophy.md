# Philosophy of tableaunoir

## Why is there no zoom?

- Because zooming would a new tool.
- Because you cannot zoom on a real board.
- Because without zoom, all the devices can display the same screen.
- Because there is usually no zoom in video games.

## Why only horizontal scrolling?

- Because we need to give a structure to a course. Going in all directions is crazy.
- Because vertical scrolling gives less structures. As we write from top-to-bottom it is nice to add a separation in "panels"/"boards" that is horizontal, that gives more structure.


## Why can't I modify the style of the lines (dotted, linewidth)?
- Because you can already do that! For having a thicker line, just draw it several times on the same point. To draw a dotted line, simply draw dots. Tableaunoir is not a drawing software but a software to teach.
